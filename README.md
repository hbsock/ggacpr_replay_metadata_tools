# GG AC+R replay metadata tool
* The intent of this is for me to learn golang, and I thought it would be a good exercise to do that by learning to parse metadata from the only game I play regularly these days, Guilty Gear Accent Core +R.
* I have referenced the link: https://steamcommunity.com/app/348550/discussions/0/3203746177244378016/ for info on the metadata in the replay files.
* Maybe in the future I'll do something more with said metadata while learning golang like converting it into different file format outputs (csv, json, etc), learn how to insert the data onto a SQL database, or maybe I'll do nothing at all.

## For running tests:
```
go test ./...
```

## Install
```
go get -u github.com/hbsock/ggacpr_replay_metadata_tools
